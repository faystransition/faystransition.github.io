My research falls into two aspects of condensed matter physics, theoretical and experimental. It plays an key role in my Ph.D. and undergraduate studies.  My current research topics are strongly correlated systems involving unconventional superconductivity, magnetism, vestigial order and phase transition supervised by Rafael Fernandes. Approaches applied include phenomenological models with analytical skills, numerical computation through Minnesota Supercomputing Institute.  Besides, the studies also gain crucial insights from the empirical results in experiments such as neutron scattering, nonlinear response.


On the other hand, when I was an undergraduate, I worked on experimental condensed matter physics project supervised by Dihu Chen. My research includes synthesis, characterization (structural, magnetic, fluorescent, in vitro and in vivo properties) of lanthanide doped gadolinium oxide nanoparticles, which serves as a promising candidate for the dual-modal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent.  Meanwhile, I also worked on some side projects related to first principle calculation and thus developed great interest in numerical computation.
